Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for image recognition. They work by finding a boundary that separates different classes of images, and then using that boundary to classify new images. Here is an example of an SVM implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library
